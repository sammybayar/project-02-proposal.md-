Write a brief proposal (a few sentences) on what you plan to do for Project 2: Green Screen and push it to your repository

I never made a zoom background video, so I don't really know what I am going to do yet, but I am thinking of making it fun, honestly, I was thinking of doing the backrooms as my project,
or the office the nightguard is in, from the first FNAF game. I have a few pictures but I don't know if that will work.
